Overview

The purpose of this application being built is to ease the communication and networking between young black entrepreneurs. I'd love to categorize different tabs for the users to use to help them search for different products they are looking for. Like on Etsy, I'd like the have an area that customers are able to communicate with the sellers. The application also have a sign in process so you wouldn't have to input all your information on each visit, either by typing out or two-step authentication. I'd like the program to include a scanner to scan all credit cards also so the users wouldn't have to type it out.



Goals of Application

-Create an application dedicated to spread of black love and positivity

-Create a rating system to see how customers feel towards both the program and sellers

-Implement a Sort and Filter column for pricing and narrowing down searches
